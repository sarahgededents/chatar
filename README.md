# Get automated prono for QuintÃ© horse bets based on PMU info

ðŸš€ Install *selenium* dependency with ```pip install selenium```, then add required drivers to your system path (*geckodriver* here).

Create *id.txt* (email,pwd,name) and *emails.txt* (email1,email2,...,emailn) files.

To get the prono by email, execute the following command: ```python sender.py```.

The PMU must have published info about the run... So, don't be surprised if it crashes...
